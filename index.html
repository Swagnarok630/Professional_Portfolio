        <p>Avid gamer and hard worker, looking to learn coding and apply it to future endeavors. Maybe possibly even find a career for it.
           I'm definitely not good at frontend developing, in my honest opinion, so I'd like to focus on backend stuff. I tried learning
           coding in community college, but I just didn't have the focus to stick with it. While the subject itself was very interesting
           to me, it felt droll due to my instructor. I ended up dropping out of the class and pursuing other interests</p>

        <br>

        <p>Fast forward to now, here I am for this bootcamp. Part of me is here because I'm looking to get out of my current career and 
           into something more interesting and possibly more lucrative. My interest for coding is still there and I'm really enjoying the
           stuff we're learning. Especially the JavaScript stuff. It feels more for me than HTML and CSS. I'm determined to not give up,
           despite my lack of free time and struggles with juggling work and other priorities. I will get through this and I will succeed.
